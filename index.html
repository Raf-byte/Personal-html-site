    <h3>Education Journey</h3>
    <p>
      My education journey is all over the place. Its kinda funny in a way. It
      somewhat sad but it also did help me in some certain ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My early education was in home and in some local Schools that i dont
        even remember now.
      </li>
      <li>
        I shifted abroad to Bahrain where i studied from class two to class four
        at Bangladesh School Bahrain.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend my High School at Life Preparatory School and Uttara Residential
        School and College
      </li>
      <li>
        I finished my <strong>SSC</strong> from Nawab Habibullah Model School
        and College. This is where i made my only friend that i would have like
        to call my bestfrien MD Yeasin Biplob, who kept in touch till this day.
      </li>
      <li>
        I finished my <strong>HSC</strong> from Uttara High School and College.
        I did very bad in my HSC. It was because of the addiction of games i had
        before. If it was not for my family i wouldnt be able to continue on my
        dream. Their support is the greatest thing Allah has gave me.
      </li>

            built with i13 12100f and Rx 6600xt. Hope it will at least be ok for

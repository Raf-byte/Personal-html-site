        <h4>Reading</h4>
        <p>
          I love stories. I never loved reading. But there is no better way to
          enjoy a good story without reading book. I started Reading when I was in
          HSC and it was beacause of two friend. The fun fact is that, those two
          friend stopped reading and now i am the one telling them WTH. <br />
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mahedihassanrafin">My collection of books</a>  is not big. Hell I cant even finish reading
          waht I have.

        <h4>Games</h4>
        <p>
          Its a necessary evil at this point. And i love it! I hope it never
          dies. Games have helped me go through so many phases of my life that
          now i cant imaging my life without it. It encouraged me to keep moving
          forward in life. I also met a lot of amazing people that I wish I had
          never lost. Now i want to make games so that people can feel the same
          amount of emotion i felt when i grew up.
          <br />
          Just so that these beautiful moment of me in my games dont only stay
          with me, I upload some of them in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmx-1cpUPrJaCvY9vMAgcIw">My Youtube Channel</a>.

        <h4>Travelling</h4>
        <p>
          Well this Hobby can only be discovered while actually doing it. I
          always had a wonder about travelling with friends. One can only
          appreciate this hobby when they are in awe when they reach such
          locations. But travelling alome is not really my thing. But it could
          just be that i haven't tried it yet.
